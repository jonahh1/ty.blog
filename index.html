                <h2>Why I Decided To Apply Here</h2>
                <p>I have an interest in programming, I particularly like developing desktop apps in c#. <br/>(ie. boring stuff like text editors or digital notepads)<br/><br/>The latest thing I am making is a Terminal or Shell but with a file explorer on the side to make it easier to visualise where you are when using a terminal.<br/>Although I like making desktop apps I still don't know what I want to do once I leave school and thought this work experience program could help me decide, or at least give me a better understanding of what to expect from a job developing software. So far (Tuesday) I have enjoyed RedHat and I look forward to the rest of the week</p>

                <h2>Monday</h2>
                <p>Monday was an introduction to RedHat as a company. We were given an explanation of what <i>"open source software"</i> means and how RedHat manages to make money while being an open source company.<br/>Before that however we were each assigned a laptop and told how to set it up with software we needed for the week. We were given a tour of the building and towards the end we set up the website/blog that you are reading right now</p>

                <h2>Tuesday</h2>
                <p>On Tuesday we were given an hour or so to work on our blog, I used the time to finalise the design I wanted to go for. There was a talk in the board room about what Agile is and how it helps developers to create and implement features quicker. <br><br>By then It was getting close to the break but after that there was a workshop on python and the micro:bit. After that had finished up we were given the chance to ask a few questions.</p>

                <h2>Wednesday</h2>
                <p>Today was a more relaxed day. There were two talks and in between them we had the task of building the <i>"LEGO McLaren Formula 1 Race Car"</i>. One talk was about the life of a software engineer and the other was about what to expect from colleges or universities</p>
